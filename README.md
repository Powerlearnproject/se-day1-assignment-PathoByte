Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
- Importance: it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including healthcare, communication, and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. development of programming languages such as C
2. establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- requirements: the gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements
- design: creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
- implementation: writing of the code and building the software according to design specifications
- testing: conduction of various tests that ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements
- deployment: release of the software to users
- maintenance: provision of ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after its deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- waterfall - linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
  scenarios appropriate; healthcare systems, military or aerospace software
- agile - iterative and flexible approach that focuses on delivering small, functional parts of the project in short cycles
  scenarios appropriate; pharmaceutical research software, startups and tech products.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer - writes code and implements software solutions

quality assurance engineer - ensures quality software by designing and executing test plans

project manager - oversees planning, execution, and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs - provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio, eclipse

VCS- software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- tight deadlines
- technical debt
- changing requirements

strategies to overcome: agile methodologies, effective communication, task prioritization and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- unit-testing - testing of individual components or modules of software
- integration - testing interactions between different components or subsystems
- system - testing the entire software system as a whole.
- acceptance - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

Importance: they help identify and fix defects early in development, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering - crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
Importance- it makes one's questions specific and clear so the AI understands what exactly is needed this helps avoid the generation of confusing answers


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt - tell me about cells
improved prompt - explain the structure and function of human cells focusing on the cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplas,m and mitochondria.

improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, and concise
